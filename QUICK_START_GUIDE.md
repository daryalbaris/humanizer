## 🛠️ Component Overview

### Processing Pipeline (Per Section)

```
Original Text
    ↓
1. Term Protection (1-2s)
   austenite → <TERM_001>
    ↓
2. Adversarial Paraphrasing (10-30s)
   Claude Sonnet guided rewrite
    ↓
3. Fingerprint Removal (1-2s)
   Remove "Additionally", "Furthermore" clusters
    ↓
4. Burstiness Enhancement (2-5s)
   Vary sentence lengths (Methods: 15-25 words)
    ↓
5. Term Restoration (1s)
   <TERM_001> → austenite
    ↓
6. Quality Validation (5-10s)
   BERTScore ≥ 0.92, BLEU ≥ 0.80
    ↓
7. Detection Analysis (5-15s)
   AI probability estimate
    ↓
IF detection > 20% → ITERATE (max 5 times)
IF detection < 20% → NEXT SECTION
```

## 📝 Example Transformation

### Input (AI-generated, 99% detection):

> "The microstructural evolution was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the mechanical properties were evaluated through Vickers hardness testing. Furthermore, the phase transformations were analyzed via X-ray diffraction. It is important to note that the austenite grain size plays a crucial role in determining the material's performance."

### Output (Humanized, 16% detection):

> "Microstructural evolution was examined through scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties were assessed using Vickers hardness measurements. Phase transformations were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Austenite grain size significantly influences material performance."

**Changes:**
- ✓ Removed "Additionally", "Furthermore" (AI fingerprints)
- ✓ Removed "It is important to note", "plays a crucial role" (formulaic)
- ✓ Varied sentence structure (active/passive mix)
- ✓ Preserved technical terms (austenite, Vickers, X-ray diffraction)
- ✓ Maintained quantitative accuracy
- ✓ BERTScore: 0.94 (semantic similarity preserved)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"
**Solution:** Create `.env` file with API key

### Error: "spaCy model not found"
**Solution:** `python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf`

### Detection stays >20% after 5 iterations
**Solution:**
1. Check if technical content is too formulaic
2. Try hybrid paraphrasing method
3. Manual editing (see Human-in-Loop section)

### BERTScore <0.92 (quality degradation)
**Solution:** System auto-rollbacks to previous checkpoint. Check logs.

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Speed Up Processing:
- Use smaller spaCy model: `en_core_web_sm` (faster, less accurate)
- Reduce max_iterations: 3 instead of 5
- Skip BLEU calculation (BERTScore only)

### Reduce API Costs:
- Use back-translation as primary method (no Claude usage)
- Lower temperature for Claude (0.5 → less creative, faster)
- Cache results for identical sections

### Improve Detection Evasion:
- Increase max_iterations to 7
- Enable human-in-loop for borderline cases (15-20%)
- Use hybrid paraphrasing method

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_term_protector.py
pytest tests/test_paraphraser.py
pytest tests/test_validator.py
```

### Integration Test:
```bash
python src/pipeline/pipeline.py \
  --input data/examples/sample_paper.md \
  --output projects/test/output.md \
  --project projects/test
```

### Manual Component Test:
```python
from src.components.term_protector import TermProtector

protector = TermProtector("data/glossary/metallurgy_terms.json")
text = "AISI 304 steel at 1050°C"
protected = protector.protect(text)
print(protected)  # <TERM_001> steel at 1050<TERM_002>
```

## 📊 Cost Calculator

| Paper Length | Sections | Iterations | Claude Tokens | DeepL Chars | Total Cost |
|--------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 3000 words   | 5        | 2.5 avg    | ~25K          | 2K          | $0.50      |
| 5000 words   | 6        | 3 avg      | ~36K          | 5K          | $0.75      |
| 8000 words   | 7        | 3.5 avg    | ~50K          | 8K          | $1.20      |

**Formula:**
- Claude: (input_tokens × $0.003/1K) + (output_tokens × $0.015/1K)
- DeepL: characters × $0.020/1K
- Total = Claude + DeepL

## 🆘 Support

### Common Issues:

**"Quality degradation after paraphrasing"**
→ System auto-rollbacks. Check `checkpoints/` for previous versions.

**"High detection after 5 iterations"**
→ Trigger manual editing or try hybrid method.

**"API rate limit exceeded"**
→ Add exponential backoff (built-in). Wait 60s and retry.

**"Technical terms corrupted"**
→ Term protector should prevent this. Check glossary completeness.
