Unit tests for imperfection_injector.py

Tests:
- Hesitation marker injection (section-aware)
- Academic filler word injection
- Punctuation variation (Oxford comma, em dash vs parentheses)
- Structural imperfections (start with "And", etc.)
- Intensity levels (minimal, light, moderate)
- JSON I/O interface
- Error handling
- Reproducibility (with seed)
