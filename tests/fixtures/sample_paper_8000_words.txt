Heat Treatment Optimization of SAF 2507 Super Duplex Stainless Steel: Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Property Enhancement

Abstract

This comprehensive study investigates the heat treatment optimization of SAF 2507 super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) with emphasis on microstructural evolution and mechanical property enhancement. SAF 2507, containing 25Cr-7Ni-4Mo-0.27N, represents a critical alloy system for oil and gas applications requiring exceptional corrosion resistance and mechanical strength. The research systematically examines solution treatment temperatures ranging from 1050°C to 1150°C, followed by controlled quenching procedures. Microstructural characterization was performed using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Phase quantification employed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis complemented by image analysis software. Mechanical testing included Charpy V-notch impact tests, tensile tests according to ASTM E8, and hardness measurements. Results demonstrate that solution treatment at 1100°C for 30 minutes achieves optimal austenite-ferrite balance (52% austenite, 48% ferrite) while minimizing detrimental sigma phase formation. This treatment yields superior mechanical properties: tensile strength of 850 MPa, yield strength of 550 MPa, elongation of 28%, and Charpy impact energy of 95 J at room temperature. The study establishes critical relationships between processing parameters, microstructural features, and resultant properties, providing industrial guidelines for heat treatment optimization of super duplex stainless steels.

Introduction

Super duplex stainless steels represent an advanced class of ferrous alloys characterized by their dual-phase microstructure consisting of approximately equal proportions of austenite (FCC) and ferrite (BCC) at room temperature. Among commercial SDSS grades, SAF 2507 (UNS S32750) stands out due to its exceptional combination of mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and weldability. The nominal composition of 25 wt% chromium, 7 wt% nickel, 4 wt% molybdenum, and 0.27 wt% nitrogen positions this alloy at the forefront of materials for aggressive environments including offshore oil platforms, chemical processing equipment, and desalination plants.

The microstructural integrity of SAF 2507 critically depends on thermomechanical processing history, particularly solution treatment parameters. During manufacturing, hot working at temperatures between 1000°C and 1250°C produces a predominantly ferritic structure. Subsequent controlled cooling allows austenite nucleation and growth from ferrite grain boundaries and within ferrite grains. The austenite-ferrite phase balance significantly influences corrosion resistance, with deviations from optimal ratios potentially degrading performance. Excessive ferrite content reduces pitting resistance and impact toughness, while austenite-rich microstructures may exhibit lower strength and increased susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking.

A paramount concern in SDSS processing involves sigma phase precipitation during exposure to temperatures between 600°C and 1000°C. Sigma phase, an iron-chromium intermetallic compound with tetragonal crystal structure, forms through eutectoid decomposition of ferrite. This brittle phase drastically reduces toughness and corrosion resistance by depleting chromium and molybdenum from the surrounding matrix. Industrial processing must carefully control cooling rates and avoid prolonged exposure to sigma-forming temperature ranges. Solution treatment serves dual purposes: homogenizing composition and dissolving any sigma phase formed during prior processing steps.

Current industrial practice for SAF 2507 typically specifies solution treatment at 1080°C to 1150°C followed by water quenching. However, limited systematic research addresses the precise optimization of solution treatment temperature and time for achieving superior mechanical properties while maintaining corrosion resistance. This knowledge gap motivates the present investigation, which employs a methodical approach to correlate processing parameters with microstructural features and mechanical performance. The research aims to establish evidence-based heat treatment guidelines applicable to industrial manufacturing of critical components from SAF 2507.

The significance of this research extends beyond academic interest, addressing practical challenges in oil and gas infrastructure development. Subsea equipment operating at depths exceeding 3000 meters encounters extreme pressures, chloride-rich environments, and mechanical stresses. Material failure can result in catastrophic consequences including environmental damage, economic losses, and safety hazards. Optimizing SAF 2507 heat treatment enhances component reliability, potentially extending service life and reducing maintenance costs. Furthermore, understanding microstructure-property relationships enables development of next-generation super duplex alloys with enhanced performance characteristics.

Materials and Methods

Material Specification and Chemical Composition

The experimental material consisted of commercially supplied SAF 2507 super duplex stainless steel plates with thickness of 25 mm manufactured according to ASTM A240 standards. Chemical composition was verified using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and presented in Table 1. The material exhibited composition within specification limits with chromium content of 25.2 wt%, nickel of 6.9 wt%, molybdenum of 3.8 wt%, and nitrogen of 0.27 wt%. Iron constituted the balance element. Trace elements including manganese (0.8 wt%), silicon (0.4 wt%), copper (0.15 wt%), and carbon (0.018 wt%) were present at levels typical for this grade. The pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN), calculated as Cr + 3.3Mo + 16N, yielded a value of 42.5, confirming the material's superior corrosion resistance classification.

Specimen Preparation

Test specimens were machined from the as-received plates using electrical discharge machining (EDM) to minimize work hardening and residual stresses. Tensile test specimens followed ASTM E8 dimensional requirements with gauge length of 50 mm, width of 12.5 mm, and thickness of 6 mm. Charpy V-notch impact specimens measured 10 × 10 × 55 mm with a 2 mm deep 45° V-notch machined to ASTM E23 specifications. Metallographic samples measured 20 × 20 × 10 mm with the largest surface parallel to the rolling direction. All specimens underwent grinding with SiC papers up to 1200 grit followed by polishing with diamond suspension (6 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm) to achieve mirror finish suitable for microscopic examination.

Heat Treatment Procedures

Solution treatment experiments employed a programmable electric resistance furnace with temperature control accuracy of ±5°C. Five treatment temperatures were investigated: 1050°C, 1075°C, 1100°C, 1125°C, and 1150°C. For each temperature, holding times of 15, 30, and 60 minutes were evaluated, totaling 15 experimental conditions. Specimens were heated at a rate of 10°C/min to the target temperature. Following isothermal holding, specimens underwent rapid quenching in water at 25°C to retain the high-temperature microstructure. Temperature monitoring utilized calibrated K-type thermocouples attached to specimen surfaces and positioned adjacent to specimens within the furnace chamber. The experimental matrix enabled systematic evaluation of both temperature and time effects on microstructural evolution.

Microstructural Characterization

Metallographic preparation for optical microscopy involved electrolytic etching in 40% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution at 3V DC for 30 seconds. This etchant preferentially attacks ferrite, revealing austenite-ferrite phase contrast. Phase fractions were quantified using an optical microscope equipped with image analysis software. For each condition, measurements from 15 randomly selected fields at 200× magnification provided statistical representation. Grain size determination followed the linear intercept method according to ASTM E112, with at least 500 grain intersections counted per specimen.

Scanning electron microscopy utilized a field emission SEM operating at 15 kV accelerating voltage. Secondary electron imaging revealed surface topography and phase morphology at magnifications up to 10,000×. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) enabled local chemical composition analysis with spatial resolution of approximately 1 μm. Line scans across austenite-ferrite boundaries quantified element partitioning, particularly chromium, nickel, and molybdenum distribution.

Electron backscatter diffraction mapping employed a step size of 0.5 μm over areas measuring 200 × 200 μm. Crystallographic orientation data enabled construction of inverse pole figure maps, misorientation angle distributions, and phase identification based on crystal structure. Sigma phase identification utilized its distinct tetragonal structure distinguishable from cubic austenite and ferrite phases.

X-ray diffraction analysis used Cu Kα radiation with wavelength of 1.54 Å. Scans covered 2θ range from 30° to 100° with step size of 0.02° and counting time of 2 seconds per step. Rietveld refinement of diffraction patterns provided quantitative phase analysis with accuracy of ±2% for major phases. Sigma phase detection limit was approximately 1 vol%.

Mechanical Testing

Tensile tests were conducted on a universal testing machine with load capacity of 100 kN at crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, corresponding to strain rate of approximately 3 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹. An extensometer with 50 mm gauge length measured strain. For each heat treatment condition, three specimens were tested to ensure reproducibility. Engineering stress-strain curves yielded yield strength (0.2% offset), ultimate tensile strength, elongation to failure, and reduction of area.

Charpy V-notch impact tests followed ASTM E23 procedures using a 300 J capacity pendulum impact tester. Tests were performed at room temperature (25°C), 0°C, and -40°C to evaluate temperature dependence of toughness. For each temperature, five specimens were tested to account for scatter inherent in impact testing. Fracture surfaces were examined using SEM to identify fracture mechanisms (ductile, brittle, or mixed mode).

Vickers hardness measurements employed a 10 kg load with 15 second dwell time. For each specimen, 20 indentations were made following ASTM E92 spacing requirements. Measurements were performed on both austenite and ferrite phases individually (microhardness) and on the bulk material (macrohardness) to assess phase-specific properties and overall hardness.

Results

Microstructural Evolution with Solution Treatment Temperature

Optical microscopy revealed distinct microstructural evolution as a function of solution treatment temperature. Specimens treated at 1050°C for 30 minutes exhibited a ferrite-rich microstructure with approximately 62% ferrite and 38% austenite. The austenite phase appeared as islands and stringers within the ferritic matrix, indicative of incomplete transformation from the high-temperature ferritic condition. Grain boundaries were relatively straight with limited austenite precipitation.

Increasing solution temperature to 1075°C promoted austenite formation, shifting the phase balance to 55% ferrite and 45% austenite. Austenite islands enlarged and adopted more irregular morphologies, with increased precipitation along ferrite grain boundaries. Some austenite grains exhibited Widmanstätten morphology, growing as plates from ferrite boundaries into ferrite grains.

The optimal microstructure emerged at 1100°C, achieving near-ideal phase balance of 48% ferrite and 52% austenite. Austenite formed a continuous network along ferrite boundaries while also appearing as uniformly distributed islands within ferrite grains. Both phases exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with average grain sizes of 45 μm for ferrite and 35 μm for austenite. This refined, balanced microstructure maximizes the synergistic benefits of both phases.

Further temperature elevation to 1125°C and 1150°C progressively increased austenite fraction to 58% and 65%, respectively. At 1150°C, austenite became the matrix phase with ferrite appearing as isolated islands. Grain coarsening became evident, with some ferrite grains exceeding 80 μm diameter. This austenite-rich condition deviates from the optimal duplex character desired for superior performance.

Effect of Holding Time on Phase Balance

At the optimal temperature of 1100°C, holding time variation revealed important kinetic considerations. After 15 minutes, the microstructure contained 45% ferrite and 55% austenite, slightly austenite-rich compared to the ideal 50:50 balance. The transformation from ferrite to austenite was essentially complete by 30 minutes, achieving 48% ferrite content. Extended holding to 60 minutes produced minimal further change, maintaining 47% ferrite, suggesting equilibrium had been reached.

Grain size evolution showed continuous growth with increasing holding time. At 15 minutes, average ferrite grain size measured 38 μm. This increased to 45 μm at 30 minutes and 62 μm at 60 minutes. Excessive grain growth at extended times degrades toughness and may reduce corrosion resistance by decreasing grain boundary area. Therefore, 30-minute holding provides optimal balance between achieving complete transformation and limiting grain coarsening.

Sigma Phase Formation and Dissolution

X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of sigma phase in as-received material, quantified at 3.2 vol%. This brittle intermetallic formed during slow cooling following hot working at the steel mill. Sigma phase peaks appeared at 2θ angles of 44.8°, 45.6°, and 47.2°, corresponding to the (330), (411), and (004) reflections of the tetragonal structure.

Solution treatment effectively dissolved sigma phase, with dissolution kinetics strongly temperature-dependent. At 1050°C for 30 minutes, sigma content decreased to 1.8 vol%, representing 44% dissolution. Increasing temperature to 1075°C achieved 0.5 vol% sigma (84% dissolution). Complete dissolution below XRD detection limits occurred at 1100°C within 15 minutes. This confirms that minimum solution treatment temperature of 1100°C is required for full sigma phase elimination.

Prolonged exposure at intermediate temperatures (700°C to 900°C) during slow cooling from solution treatment can promote sigma re-precipitation. Therefore, rapid quenching is critical. Water quenching from 1100°C achieved cooling rates exceeding 100°C/s through the sigma-forming temperature range, effectively suppressing re-precipitation.

Elemental Partitioning Between Phases

EDS line scan analysis across austenite-ferrite interfaces revealed significant compositional differences between phases. Austenite consistently showed higher nickel concentration (approximately 9 wt%) compared to ferrite (5 wt%). This reflects nickel's strong austenite-stabilizing character. Conversely, chromium and molybdenum preferentially partitioned to ferrite, with chromium at 27 wt% in ferrite versus 23 wt% in austenite. Molybdenum exhibited even stronger partitioning, measuring 5.2 wt% in ferrite and 2.8 wt% in austenite.

Nitrogen, the most powerful austenite stabilizer in this alloy system, concentrated heavily in austenite at approximately 0.45 wt% compared to less than 0.10 wt% in ferrite. This extreme partitioning arises from nitrogen's very low solubility in BCC ferrite versus high solubility in FCC austenite. The chromium and nitrogen partitioning has important implications for corrosion resistance, as both elements enhance passivity.

Mechanical Properties: Tensile Behavior

Tensile test results demonstrated clear correlations between microstructure and mechanical performance. Specimens solution treated at 1050°C (ferrite-rich condition) exhibited yield strength of 580 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 820 MPa, and elongation of 22%. The high strength reflects the predominant ferrite phase, which is intrinsically stronger than austenite due to BCC crystal structure and higher interstitial content.

As solution temperature increased and austenite fraction grew, yield strength gradually decreased while ductility increased. The optimal 1100°C treatment produced yield strength of 550 MPa, tensile strength of 850 MPa, elongation of 28%, and reduction of area of 65%. These properties represent an excellent strength-ductility combination. The slightly lower yield strength compared to ferrite-rich conditions is offset by superior toughness and elongation.

Austenite-rich specimens from 1150°C treatment showed yield strength of 510 MPa, tensile strength of 840 MPa, and elongation of 32%. While ductility is maximized, the reduced strength may be undesirable for applications requiring high load-bearing capacity. Additionally, the austenite-rich condition showed increased susceptibility to localized deformation and necking.

Work hardening behavior varied systematically with microstructure. Ferrite-rich specimens exhibited higher initial work hardening rates due to rapid dislocation multiplication in ferrite. Balanced duplex microstructures showed more uniform work hardening throughout plastic deformation. Austenite-rich specimens demonstrated lower work hardening rates but maintained steady strain hardening to higher strains before necking.

Impact Toughness and Temperature Dependence

Charpy V-notch impact testing revealed dramatic differences in toughness across the experimental matrix. At room temperature (25°C), the optimal 1100°C solution treatment yielded impact energy of 95 J. This exceptional toughness arises from the balanced duplex microstructure where crack propagation alternates between phases, frequently changing direction and absorbing energy through plastic deformation in austenite.

Ferrite-rich specimens (1050°C treatment) showed significantly lower room temperature impact energy of 65 J. The reduced toughness correlates with higher ferrite content, as ferrite exhibits lower intrinsic toughness than austenite. At low test temperatures, ferrite undergoes ductile-to-brittle transition, further degrading toughness.

Temperature dependence of toughness highlighted critical differences. At 0°C, specimens from 1100°C solution treatment maintained high impact energy of 88 J, while ferrite-rich specimens dropped to 42 J. At -40°C, the optimal treatment still absorbed 78 J, whereas ferrite-rich material fractured in brittle manner with only 18 J absorption. Austenite-rich specimens from 1150°C treatment showed high toughness across all temperatures (90 J at 25°C, 85 J at 0°C, 80 J at -40°C), but lack adequate strength for structural applications.

Fracture surface examination by SEM revealed mixed ductile-brittle fracture morphology in ferrite-rich specimens tested at low temperature, with cleavage facets in ferrite and dimpled rupture in austenite. Optimally treated specimens showed predominantly ductile fracture with equiaxed dimples across both phases, confirming energy absorption through plastic deformation.

Hardness Measurements

Vickers hardness measurements provided insights into phase-specific properties and overall material hardness. Ferrite phase consistently exhibited higher microhardness (280-310 HV) compared to austenite (220-250 HV). This difference reflects ferrite's higher interstitial content and inherently stronger BCC structure.

Bulk macrohardness followed the rule of mixtures, with values proportional to phase fractions. Ferrite-rich specimens (1050°C treatment) measured 295 HV, while balanced duplex material (1100°C treatment) measured 275 HV. Austenite-rich specimens (1150°C treatment) showed lowest hardness at 255 HV. The variation is modest but significant for applications requiring specific hardness ranges.

Grain size effects on hardness were evident when comparing different holding times at 1100°C. Specimens held for 15 minutes (finer grain size) measured 285 HV, while 30-minute treatment showed 275 HV, and 60-minute treatment (coarsened grains) measured 265 HV. This follows Hall-Petch relationship where hardness increases with decreasing grain size.

Discussion

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Considerations

The observed microstructural evolution aligns with thermodynamic predictions for the Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-N system. At solution treatment temperatures, the stable phase assemblage transitions from predominantly ferrite at lower temperatures to increasing austenite fractions at higher temperatures. The measured phase compositions agree with partitioning coefficients reported in the literature, with nickel and nitrogen strongly favoring austenite while chromium and molybdenum partition preferentially to ferrite.

Kinetic analysis reveals that austenite formation from ferrite occurs rapidly, approaching equilibrium within 30 minutes at 1100°C. The transformation proceeds through nucleation at ferrite grain boundaries followed by growth into ferrite grains. Nitrogen, with extremely low diffusivity in ferrite, locally enriches at transformation fronts, stabilizing austenite. The rapid transformation kinetics justify the industrial practice of relatively short solution treatment times.

Sigma phase dissolution kinetics exhibit strong temperature dependence due to the high activation energy for chromium and molybdenum diffusion in ferrite. At 1050°C, diffusion is sufficiently slow that complete dissolution requires impractically long times. At 1100°C and above, enhanced atomic mobility enables rapid sigma dissolution. The critical importance of exceeding 1100°C for sigma elimination has clear practical implications for process control.

Microstructure-Property Relationships

The correlation between austenite-ferrite balance and mechanical properties reflects the complementary characteristics of these phases. Ferrite provides strength through its BCC structure and solid solution hardening from chromium and molybdenum. Austenite contributes ductility and toughness due to its FCC structure with numerous slip systems. The optimal duplex microstructure leverages both advantages.

Impact toughness shows particular sensitivity to phase balance. The dramatic toughness reduction in ferrite-rich conditions relates to ferrite's ductile-to-brittle transition at low temperatures. The BCC structure becomes susceptible to cleavage fracture as thermal energy decreases. In contrast, austenite retains toughness to cryogenic temperatures. Balanced duplex microstructures maintain excellent toughness by ensuring sufficient austenite to resist crack propagation even when ferrite undergoes embrittlement.

The observed work hardening behavior correlates with dislocation interactions between phases. Dislocations generated during plastic deformation in ferrite encounter austenite boundaries, where they must either transmit across the interface or accumulate, creating back stress. The balanced microstructure maximizes these beneficial dislocation interactions, sustaining work hardening and delaying necking.

Implications for Corrosion Resistance

Although corrosion testing was not performed in this study, microstructural characteristics have well-established effects on corrosion resistance. The preferential partitioning of chromium and molybdenum to ferrite creates composition gradients that influence passivation behavior. Balanced duplex microstructures maximize grain boundary area, providing numerous chromium oxide healing sites if passivity is disrupted locally.

Sigma phase represents a severe corrosion hazard due to chromium and molybdenum depletion in adjacent regions. Ensuring complete sigma dissolution through adequate solution temperature is therefore critical not only for mechanical properties but also for corrosion resistance. The finding that 1100°C fully dissolves sigma within 15 minutes provides a clear process specification.

Grain size influences corrosion resistance through multiple mechanisms. Finer grains increase boundary area, potentially beneficial for repassivation. However, very fine grains in cold-worked material can increase susceptibility to intergranular attack. The grain sizes achieved with 30-minute holdings at 1100°C (40-45 μm) represent a reasonable compromise between mechanical and corrosion properties.

Practical Industrial Recommendations

Based on comprehensive evaluation of microstructure and mechanical properties, the optimal heat treatment for SAF 2507 consists of solution treatment at 1100°C for 30 minutes followed by water quenching. This protocol achieves:

1. Near-ideal austenite-ferrite balance (48% ferrite, 52% austenite)
2. Complete sigma phase dissolution
3. Optimal combination of strength (550 MPa yield, 850 MPa tensile) and ductility (28% elongation)
4. Excellent impact toughness (95 J at 25°C, 78 J at -40°C)
5. Grain size refined enough for good toughness but not so fine as to promote excessive grain growth during subsequent welding or service exposure

Deviations from this protocol have predictable consequences. Lower temperatures (1050°C-1075°C) risk incomplete sigma dissolution and produce ferrite-rich microstructures with degraded toughness. Higher temperatures (1125°C-1150°C) cause grain coarsening and austenite-rich conditions with reduced strength. Shorter holding times (15 minutes) may not fully homogenize composition, while longer times (60 minutes) cause unnecessary grain growth without further benefit.

Industrial implementation should include:
- Furnace temperature monitoring and control within ±5°C tolerance
- Verification of heating rate (10°C/min recommended)
- Ensuring specimens reach target temperature (account for thermal mass)
- Quenching medium temperature control (20-30°C water)
- Periodic microstructural verification through metallographic examination
- Mechanical property testing on production samples to confirm process effectiveness

Comparison with Literature

The present findings generally align with prior research on duplex stainless steels while providing new quantitative detail specific to SAF 2507. Previous studies on similar compositions reported optimal solution temperatures between 1080°C and 1120°C, consistent with the 1100°C optimum identified here. The phase balance achieved (48% ferrite) falls within the recommended range of 40-60% ferrite for duplex grades.

Impact toughness values of 95 J at room temperature and 78 J at -40°C exceed typical specifications for this grade, which commonly require minimum 60 J at -40°C. The superior performance may reflect careful control of nitrogen content and optimization of grain size. Published data on SAF 2507 show considerable scatter in mechanical properties, likely reflecting variations in processing and testing conditions. The present systematic approach provides a clearer picture of inherent material capabilities.

Sigma phase dissolution kinetics observed here (complete dissolution within 15 minutes at 1100°C) are faster than some literature reports suggesting 30-60 minute requirements. This may reflect differences in prior sigma content, heating rates, or analytical detection limits. The comprehensive characterization approach employed here, combining XRD, SEM, and EBSD, provides high confidence in the dissolution results.

Limitations and Future Work

This study focused exclusively on solution treatment optimization, representing only one aspect of complete processing. Several areas warrant further investigation:

1. Quenching rate effects: While water quenching was employed throughout, varying quench rates (oil quenching, air cooling, etc.) would reveal minimum cooling rates to suppress sigma precipitation.

2. Corrosion testing: Direct measurement of pitting resistance (CPT, PREN), stress corrosion cracking susceptibility, and intergranular corrosion resistance should complement mechanical property data.

3. Weldability: Heat-affected zone microstructures and properties require characterization, as welding represents a critical manufacturing process for this alloy.

4. Thermal aging: Long-term exposure at service temperatures (250°C-400°C) may cause microstructural evolution, including chromium nitride precipitation and additional sigma formation.

5. Mechanical property anisotropy: The present study examined specimens oriented in the rolling direction. Transverse and through-thickness orientations should be evaluated to fully characterize property anisotropy.

6. Computational modeling: Thermodynamic and kinetic modeling using Calphad methods could predict phase equilibria and transformation kinetics, reducing experimental effort for alloy variants.

Conclusion

This comprehensive investigation of heat treatment optimization for SAF 2507 super duplex stainless steel establishes evidence-based processing guidelines for achieving superior mechanical properties. Key conclusions include:

1. Solution treatment at 1100°C for 30 minutes produces optimal austenite-ferrite balance (48% ferrite, 52% austenite) with refined grain structure (40-45 μm).

2. This treatment completely dissolves detrimental sigma phase within 15 minutes, with no evidence of re-precipitation during water quenching.

3. Mechanical properties achieved include yield strength of 550 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 850 MPa, elongation of 28%, and Charpy impact energy of 95 J at 25°C and 78 J at -40°C.

4. Lower solution temperatures (1050°C-1075°C) produce ferrite-rich microstructures with degraded toughness and incomplete sigma dissolution. Higher temperatures (1125°C-1150°C) cause grain coarsening and austenite-rich conditions with reduced strength.

5. Elemental partitioning between phases follows expected patterns with nickel and nitrogen enriching austenite while chromium and molybdenum preferentially partition to ferrite.

6. The identified optimal heat treatment provides a balanced property combination suitable for demanding applications requiring both high strength and exceptional toughness at cryogenic temperatures.

These findings provide actionable guidance for industrial processing of SAF 2507, enabling manufacturers to consistently achieve superior component performance for critical oil and gas infrastructure applications.
