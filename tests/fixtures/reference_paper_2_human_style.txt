Pitting Corrosion Resistance of Duplex Stainless Steels: Comparative Study of 2205 and 2507 Grades

Abstract

This research compares the pitting corrosion resistance of two common duplex stainless steel grades: 2205 (UNS S31803) and 2507 (UNS S32750) in chloride-containing environments. Electrochemical testing using potentiodynamic polarization and critical pitting temperature (CPT) measurements was conducted in 3.5% NaCl solution. Microstructural analysis via scanning electron microscopy identified pit initiation sites and propagation mechanisms. Results show that 2507 exhibits superior pitting resistance with CPT of 68°C compared to 41°C for 2205, attributable to higher molybdenum and nitrogen content yielding PREN values of 42.5 versus 35.0. Pitting preferentially initiated at austenite-ferrite phase boundaries and within the ferrite phase due to molybdenum depletion. Understanding these differences helps in material selection for chloride-rich environments such as seawater applications and chemical processing plants.

Introduction and Background

Duplex stainless steels combine austenite and ferrite phases in roughly equal proportions, offering advantages over conventional austenitic or ferritic grades. The dual-phase microstructure provides higher strength than austenitic steels while maintaining superior toughness compared to fully ferritic grades. Additionally, duplex steels exhibit excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking and pitting corrosion, making them attractive for aggressive service environments.

Among commercially available duplex grades, 2205 and 2507 represent two performance tiers. Grade 2205 is the workhorse material accounting for approximately 80% of duplex steel consumption. It contains nominally 22% chromium, 5% nickel, and 3% molybdenum. The super duplex 2507 grade contains higher alloy content: 25% chromium, 7% nickel, and 4% molybdenum, plus elevated nitrogen levels around 0.27%. These compositional differences significantly impact corrosion resistance.

Pitting corrosion poses a serious threat to stainless steels in chloride environments. This localized attack initiates at weak points in the passive film, creating small holes that propagate into the material. Once initiated, pits create autocatalytic conditions that sustain corrosion even if the bulk environment would normally be non-aggressive. Preventing pit initiation through appropriate material selection is therefore critical.

The pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) provides a useful empirical ranking of pitting resistance based on composition: PREN = %Cr + 3.3(%Mo) + 16(%N). For 2205, PREN calculates to approximately 35, while 2507 achieves about 42.5. Laboratory testing is necessary to validate that this compositional advantage translates to superior performance under realistic conditions.

The present study aims to quantify the pitting resistance difference between 2205 and 2507 through electrochemical testing and microstructural characterization. We focus on chloride environments representative of seawater and brackish water applications. Understanding the performance gap helps engineers make informed material selections based on service requirements and cost considerations.

Materials and Experimental Methods

Material Procurement and Preparation

We obtained commercial duplex stainless steel plates of both 2205 and 2507 grades from the same manufacturer to minimize processing variations. Chemical compositions were verified through optical emission spectroscopy and are presented in Table 1. Both materials were supplied in the solution-annealed condition with certification per ASTM A240 standards.

Specimens for electrochemical testing were machined to 10 mm diameter cylinders and mounted in cold-setting epoxy resin, exposing a 0.785 cm² test surface. Surface preparation consisted of grinding with silicon carbide papers through 600 grit, followed by degreasing in acetone and ethanol. This moderately rough surface is more representative of industrial components than highly polished laboratory specimens.

Metallographic samples underwent standard preparation: grinding through 1200 grit, polishing with diamond suspensions (6 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm), and final polishing with colloidal silica. Etching used Beraha's reagent (20 mL HCl, 80 mL water, 1g K₂S₂O₅) applied for 15-30 seconds, which differentially colors austenite and ferrite for easy phase identification.

Electrochemical Testing Procedures

Potentiodynamic polarization tests employed a standard three-electrode cell with the test specimen as working electrode, saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and platinum mesh counter electrode. The test solution was 3.5 wt% NaCl prepared from reagent grade sodium chloride and deionized water. Solution temperature was maintained at 25°C ± 1°C using a water-jacketed cell.

Prior to each test, specimens were cathodically cleaned at -1.0 V vs SCE for 5 minutes to remove any surface oxides, then allowed to stabilize at open circuit potential for 30 minutes. Polarization scans started from -0.3 V vs open circuit potential and proceeded anodically at scan rate of 0.5 mV/s until either current density exceeded 5 mA/cm² or potential reached +1.0 V vs SCE.

Critical pitting temperature (CPT) measurements used a similar setup but with controlled temperature ramping. Specimens were potentiostatically held at +700 mV vs SCE (well above typical pitting potentials) while solution temperature increased at 1°C per minute starting from 20°C. The CPT was defined as the temperature at which current density exceeded 100 μA/cm² and continued rising, indicating stable pit propagation.

Each test condition was replicated three times to assess reproducibility. After electrochemical testing, specimens were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy to identify pit morphology and distribution.

Results: Electrochemical Behavior

Potentiodynamic polarization curves for both alloys in 3.5% NaCl at 25°C revealed distinct differences in pitting resistance. Grade 2205 exhibited pitting potential (E_pit) of +420 mV vs SCE with standard deviation of ±35 mV across three tests. In contrast, 2507 showed E_pit of +710 mV vs SCE (±25 mV), representing a 290 mV improvement in pitting resistance.

The corrosion potential (E_corr) was similar for both grades: -180 mV for 2205 and -165 mV for 2507. This indicates that the passive film characteristics in the stable region are comparable, but the breakdown resistance differs significantly. The passive current density between E_corr and E_pit was low for both alloys (0.5-1.5 μA/cm²), confirming stable passive film formation in chloride solution at room temperature.

Upon reaching E_pit, current density increased sharply, indicating transition from passive to active pitting corrosion. The current rise was more gradual for 2205 compared to the sharper transition observed for 2507. This suggests that 2205 may experience metastable pitting (pits that initiate but repassivate) over a wider potential range before establishing stable pit growth.

Critical pitting temperature measurements provided another performance metric. Grade 2205 exhibited CPT of 41°C (±2°C) while 2507 achieved 68°C (±3°C). This 27°C difference is highly significant for practical applications. For example, seawater temperature in tropical regions can reach 30-35°C, approaching the CPT limit for 2205 but well below the threshold for 2507.

The PREN correlation with CPT showed reasonable agreement. The approximately 7.5 point difference in PREN (42.5 vs 35.0) corresponds to roughly 27°C difference in CPT, suggesting approximately 3.5°C per PREN unit for these duplex grades in chloride solution.

Microstructural Analysis of Corrosion Sites

Optical microscopy of as-received materials revealed typical duplex microstructures with approximately 50% ferrite (appearing dark after Beraha etching) and 50% austenite (light phase). Both alloys exhibited similar grain sizes around 30-40 μm with austenite forming both grain boundary networks and islands within ferrite grains.

After potentiodynamic polarization testing, specimens were examined to identify pit initiation sites. On 2205 specimens, pitting occurred preferentially at three locations:

1. Austenite-ferrite phase boundaries (approximately 60% of pits)
2. Within ferrite grains away from boundaries (30% of pits)
3. At inclusions or defects (10% of pits)

The strong preference for phase boundary attack suggests that these interfaces represent weak points in the passive film. Compositional differences between phases create local galvanic couples that may facilitate pit initiation. Additionally, the boundary region may experience molybdenum and chromium depletion during thermal processing, locally reducing pitting resistance.

Grade 2507 showed similar pit location preferences but with notably fewer pits overall at equivalent applied potentials. When pitting did occur, the ferrite phase appeared more susceptible than austenite. This relates to elemental partitioning: molybdenum and chromium preferentially partition to ferrite during solidification and subsequent heat treatment. However, nitrogen (a strong pitting resistance enhancer) concentrates heavily in austenite. The net effect in 2507's high-nitrogen condition is that austenite gains superior pitting resistance despite lower chromium and molybdenum content.

Scanning electron microscopy revealed pit morphology differences between the two grades. In 2205, pits exhibited irregular shapes with depth-to-diameter ratios around 0.5-0.8, classified as shallow to moderate depth. Pit bottoms showed evidence of selective phase attack with ferrite corroding more rapidly than adjacent austenite, creating a stepped surface topography.

For 2507, the fewer pits that did form tended to be deeper with depth-to-diameter ratios of 0.8-1.2. Once initiated, pits in the more highly alloyed 2507 appeared to propagate more aggressively, possibly due to stronger autocatalytic acidification within the pit creating more corrosive local chemistry. However, the key advantage of 2507 is the much higher potential or temperature required to initiate pitting in the first place.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis inside pits confirmed chromium and molybdenum depletion in corroded regions. In actively corroding pit bottoms, chromium content decreased from nominal 25% to as low as 18%, while molybdenum dropped from 4% to 2.5%. These depletions destroy local passivity, enabling continued acid attack. The pit cap solution became enriched in metal chlorides, further promoting corrosion through pH reduction and chloride concentration.

Discussion and Practical Implications

The superior pitting resistance of 2507 compared to 2205 reflects fundamental composition effects, primarily the higher molybdenum and nitrogen content. Molybdenum enhances passive film stability through incorporation into chromium oxide, making it more resistant to chloride attack. Nitrogen increases pitting potential through multiple mechanisms: promoting passive film healing, raising pH within pits to suppress autocatalysis, and solid solution strengthening of austenite.

The 27°C difference in critical pitting temperature has major practical significance. For seawater piping systems, ambient water temperature varies with location and season. In temperate climates (water temp 10-20°C), both 2205 and 2507 provide excellent resistance. However, in tropical regions or heated process streams, 2205 may approach its CPT limit while 2507 maintains adequate safety margin. The material cost premium for 2507 (typically 30-50% higher than 2205) must be weighed against the enhanced reliability and potential for longer service life.

For offshore oil platforms and subsea equipment, 2507 has become the standard material for critical components due to its superior pitting and crevice corrosion resistance. The high pressure and potential for stagnant conditions in crevices create particularly aggressive environments where the extra resistance of 2507 is justified. For less critical applications like topside piping or structural elements, 2205 may suffice at significant cost savings.

Chemical processing applications require case-by-case evaluation based on specific process chemistry. Chloride concentration, temperature, pH, and presence of oxidizing species all influence corrosion behavior. As a general guideline: for chloride levels below 1000 ppm at temperatures under 40°C with near-neutral pH, 2205 typically performs adequately. For higher chloride, elevated temperature, or acidic conditions, 2507 or even higher-alloy materials (super austenitic grades or nickel alloys) may be necessary.

The preferential attack at phase boundaries identified in this study has implications for manufacturing and welding. Welding thermal cycles can promote precipitation of chromium nitrides or sigma phase at boundaries, further degrading local corrosion resistance. Proper welding procedures and post-weld heat treatment are essential to maintain the corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steels. For 2507, the higher nitrogen content increases risk of chromium nitride precipitation, requiring careful control of interpass temperature and cooling rates.

Limitations and Future Work

This study focused on pitting in neutral chloride solution, representing seawater environments. However, many industrial applications involve acidic or alkaline conditions that significantly alter corrosion mechanisms. Testing in varied pH conditions would provide a more complete performance map.

Long-term exposure testing at borderline conditions (e.g., 35-45°C for 2205, 60-70°C for 2507) would reveal whether stable pitting eventually occurs below the CPT or if these temperatures truly represent safe operating limits. Accelerated electrochemical tests may not perfectly predict long-term behavior.

Crevice corrosion, often more severe than pitting, deserves separate investigation. Crevices create occluded geometries that maintain aggressive local chemistry even when bulk environment is benign. Critical crevice temperatures are typically 10-20°C lower than CPT values.

Welded specimens should be tested to quantify the degradation in heat-affected zones. Welding fundamentally alters microstructure and composition distribution, generally reducing corrosion resistance compared to base metal. Understanding the magnitude of this degradation informs whether post-weld solution annealing is necessary.

Conclusion

This comparative study quantified the pitting corrosion resistance difference between duplex stainless steel grades 2205 and 2507 in chloride environments. The super duplex 2507 demonstrated markedly superior resistance with critical pitting temperature of 68°C compared to 41°C for standard duplex 2205, and pitting potential approximately 290 mV more noble. These performance advantages directly correlate with higher molybdenum and nitrogen content reflected in PREN values of 42.5 versus 35.0.

Microstructural analysis revealed that pitting preferentially initiates at austenite-ferrite phase boundaries and within ferrite grains due to local composition variations. The dual-phase microstructure creates inherent heterogeneity that provides weak points for corrosion initiation, though this is more than offset by the overall excellent resistance of these alloys.

For marine and chemical processing applications, 2507 provides essential performance margins in warm chloride environments where 2205 may be marginal. The material cost premium is justified for critical components where corrosion failure has severe consequences. For milder conditions, 2205 offers excellent performance at lower cost. Proper material selection requires careful analysis of worst-case service conditions, safety factors, and economic considerations.
