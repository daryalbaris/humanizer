## Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path (cannot be parallelized):**
```
Sprint 1 (STORY-001)
   ↓
Sprint 2 (STORY-002)
   ↓
Sprint 3-5 (STORY-003 + STORY-006) [STORY-004, STORY-005 parallel]
   ↓
Sprint 6-7 (STORY-007)
   ↓
Sprint 8-9 (STORY-008)
   ↓
Sprint 10 (Production hardening)
```

**Longest Path:** 21 weeks (Sprint 0 → Sprint 10)

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
- Sprint 3-5: STORY-004 and STORY-005 run parallel to STORY-003
- Sprint 8-9: Testing, documentation, deployment activities can be split across multiple developers

**Dependency Blockers:**
- STORY-007 (Orchestrator) blocks until STORY-002, 003, 004, 005, 006 complete (Sprint 5 end)
- STORY-008 (Testing) blocks until STORY-007 complete (Sprint 7 end)

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Sprints

**Sprint 4-5 (Parallel Development):**
- **Risk:** 3 parallel tracks (STORY-003, 004, 005) with 90h velocity target
- **Impact:** Team capacity strain, integration issues
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prioritize critical path (STORY-003)
  - Defer STORY-004/005 tasks to Sprint 6 if needed
  - Daily integration tests
  - Dedicated integration engineer role

**Sprint 7 (Orchestrator Completion):**
- **Risk:** Complex workflow coordination with 8 components, 20-30 Bash calls
- **Impact:** Integration bugs, performance issues
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive integration testing (32h tester allocation)
  - Staged rollout (3-component → 5-component → 8-component)
  - Detailed logging for debugging
  - Checkpoint recovery for workflow interruptions

**Sprint 10 (Production Hardening):**
- **Risk:** Undiscovered critical bugs, performance regressions
- **Impact:** Release delay, production failures
- **Mitigation:**
  - 10-paper final validation before release
  - Performance benchmarking vs Sprint 9 baseline
  - Security audit by external reviewer (if budget allows)
  - Canary release (soft launch to 10 users before public release)

### Velocity Risk

**Assumption:** 2-3 developers, 160-240 developer-hours per 2-week sprint

**Velocity Targets by Sprint:**
- Sprint 1-2: 38-45h (conservative, ramp-up period)
- Sprint 3-5: 80-90h (peak velocity, parallel tracks)
- Sprint 6-7: 55h (focused on orchestrator)
- Sprint 8-9: 60h (testing and documentation)
- Sprint 10: 40h (hardening and release prep)

**Velocity Monitoring:**
- Track actual hours per sprint (burndown charts)
- Adjust Sprint 4-5 scope if Sprint 3 under-delivers
- If team velocity <70% of target: Extend sprint or defer low-priority tasks (STORY-005 is "High" priority, can defer if needed)

---

## Team Capacity Assumptions

**Team Composition:**
- 2-3 Full-time developers (40h/week each)
- 1 Tester/QA (20-40h/week, ramping up in Sprint 7-9)
- 1 Product Manager/Lead (10-20h/week, coordination and reviews)

**Sprint Capacity (2 weeks):**
- 2 developers: 160h theoretical → 120-130h realistic (meetings, reviews, blockers)
- 3 developers: 240h theoretical → 180-200h realistic
- Tester: 40-80h (depending on sprint phase)
- PM/Lead: 20-40h (reviews, planning, stakeholder management)

**Capacity Utilization Target:** 70-80%
- Sprint 1-2: 70% (ramp-up)
- Sprint 3-7: 80% (peak productivity)
- Sprint 8-10: 75% (testing and documentation, less predictable)

**Adjustments for Velocity Misses:**
- If Sprint 3 velocity <70%: Extend Sprint 4 by 1 week OR reduce STORY-004/005 scope
- If Sprint 7 integration issues: Add Sprint 7.5 (1 week) for bug fixes
- If Sprint 9 documentation incomplete: Defer non-critical docs to post-release (v1.1)
