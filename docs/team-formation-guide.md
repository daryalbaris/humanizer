**Mitigation:**
- Tech Lead codes more (70% time on development vs 60%)
- Extend some sprints (e.g., Sprint 4-5 becomes 3 weeks instead of 2)
- Defer STORY-005 (Reference Text Analysis) to post-v1.0 (v1.1 feature)
- Total timeline: 22-24 weeks instead of 20 weeks

**Decision:** ‚òê Proceed with 2 developers ‚òê Delay start until 3rd developer found

### Scenario 2: No Tester/QA Available

**Impact:** Tech Lead and developers must do integration testing (Sprint 7-9)

**Mitigation:**
- Allocate 10-15h per developer in Sprint 7-9 for testing
- Reduce development velocity in Sprint 7-9 (55h ‚Üí 40h)
- Extend Sprint 8-9 by 1 week to accommodate testing workload
- Use external QA consultant for final validation (Sprint 10)

**Decision:** ‚òê Proceed without tester ‚òê Hire contractor for Sprint 7+

### Scenario 3: Part-Time Technical Lead (20h/week)

**Impact:** Slower code reviews, reduced mentorship, longer sprint cycles

**Mitigation:**
- Distribute code review responsibility (any 2 developers can approve PR)
- Increase asynchronous communication (detailed PR descriptions)
- Reduce sprint scope (40h ‚Üí 30h per sprint)
- Total timeline: 26-28 weeks instead of 20 weeks

**Decision:** ‚òê Proceed with part-time lead ‚òê Wait for full-time availability

## Next Steps After Team Formation

1. **Complete Sprint 0 Activities** (see pre-implementation-checklist.md)
   - Repository setup
   - requirements.txt creation
   - CI/CD configuration
   - Documentation (JSON schemas, coding standards)

2. **Sprint 1 Planning Session** (First day of Sprint 1)
   - Review STORY-001 (Environment Setup)
   - Break into 9 tasks
   - Assign tasks to developers
   - Commit to 40-hour sprint scope

3. **Begin Sprint 1 Execution**
   - Daily standups start
   - Development work begins
   - Code reviews start flowing
